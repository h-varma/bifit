The `bifit` package provides tools for bifurcation analysis and parameter estimation in mathematical models.
It includes modules for preprocessing data, generating initial guesses, solving optimization problems,
and postprocessing results. The package is designed to handle multi-experiment scenarios and supports
continuation methods for bifurcation analysis.
